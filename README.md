# Titanic Survival Prediction: Model Evaluation & Hyperparameter Tuning

## ðŸš¢ Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using machine learning models. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation using k-fold cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning with Grid Search.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)

## ðŸ“Š Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature engineering & encoding categorical variables
   - Scaling numerical features
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understanding data distribution & feature correlations
   - Visualizing survival rates by various factors
3. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Applied models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.
   - Evaluated models using **k-fold cross-validation**
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Performed **Grid Search** to optimize model performance

## ðŸ”¥ Key Results
- Identified important features influencing survival.
- Compared model performance based on cross-validation scores.
- Achieved an optimized model with improved accuracy through hyperparameter tuning.
